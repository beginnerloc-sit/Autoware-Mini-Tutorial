# Lesson 8 - Testing in the CARLA simulator

In this final lesson, you will run the whole framework from the previous lessons in closed loop inside the CARLA simulator: the simulated world reacts to your vehicle, and your vehicle must react to the world.

Two tools are used for the closed-loop validation:
* [**CARLA**](https://carla.org/) - an open-source autonomous driving simulator. It renders the world via provided map files (and we will use our own Tartu map), simulates the physics and the sensors (lidar, cameras), and feeds them to your nodes through ROS topics.
* **Visual Scenario Editor (VSE)** - a graphical tool for creating and re-playing driving scenarios in CARLA: NPC vehicles and pedestrians with routes and triggers, traffic light sequences and weather. See the [VSE repository](https://github.com/UT-ADL/visual-scenario-editor) and [how to use the editor](https://github.com/UT-ADL/visual-scenario-editor/blob/main/tutorial.md).

You will first verify that your framework can drive in CARLA, then run it through a prepared VSE scenario, and finally design scenarios yourself where your framework fails.

### Expected outcome
* Understanding how the full autonomous driving stack behaves in a closed-loop simulation
* Exploring the limits of the framework you built


## 1. Run your stack in CARLA

The launch file [lesson8.launch](launch/lesson8.launch) connects your nodes from the previous lessons to CARLA. There is no bag playback: the localization comes from the simulator, and the vehicle commands from your `pure_pursuit_follower` steer the car in the simulation.

By default the detected objects and traffic light statuses come from the simulator's ground truth instead of your perception nodes - simulating the lidar and the cameras is very heavy, and running the perception pipeline on them can slow the simulation down to a crawl. Your planner and controller are still the ones driving. If your machine can afford it, you can enable your own perception with `detector:=cluster` (lesson 5 nodes on the simulated lidar) and/or `tfl_detector:=yolo` (lesson 7 nodes on the simulated cameras).

##### Instructions
1. Start the CARLA simulator:
    ```
    $CARLA_ROOT/CarlaUE4.sh -prefernvidia -RenderOffScreen
    ```
2. In another terminal, launch your stack:
    ```
    roslaunch autoware_mini_tutorial lesson8.launch
    ```

##### Validation
* RViz opens with the Tartu map and the ego vehicle placed in the simulated city
* The `Carla image view` panel shows the third-person view of the ego vehicle in the simulated world
* Place a goal on the map - the vehicle drives to it


## 2. Run the demo scenario

A driving scenario adds actors to the otherwise empty world: NPC vehicles and pedestrians that spawn, move and react when triggered, and traffic lights that switch according to the scenario triggers. You will run the prepared demo lap scenario and see whether your framework survives traffic.

When your stack is running, VSE automatically detects your ego vehicle and hands the driving over to it - the scenario provides the destination, the other actors and the evaluation.

##### Instructions
1. With `lesson8.launch` running, start VSE and open the `tartu_demo` map. When VSE first launches, it will ask to select the agent's behavior logic. Navigate to `autoware_mini/nodes/platform/carla/` and select `carla_minimal_agent.py`.
2. Open the scenario (`Scenario` menu -> `Open`): `shared/data/scenarios/tartu_demo_route_simplified.json` from the tutorial folder
3. Press **Play**. Note: if your machine has less than 10 Gb VRAM slowdowns are expected.

##### Validation
* The goal appears in RViz automatically and the vehicle starts driving the demo lap
* NPC vehicles and pedestrians act out the scenario around the ego vehicle
* When the run ends, VSE shows a results window scoring the drive (collisions, red light violations, route completion); the same results are also saved as a text file next to the scenario JSON


## 3. Create three failure cases

Your framework from the previous lessons is a simplified one. Remember all limitations that were discussed through the lessons. In this final task you will demonstrate these limits: create three scenarios where your framework fails.

##### Instructions
1. Copy `tartu_demo_route_simplified.json` (e.g. to `failure_case_1.json`) and modify it in VSE - move, add, retime or reroute actors and triggers until your stack demonstrably fails, while a careful human driver would still manage
2. For every failure case, think of a specific change to the framework that would fix it. You do not need implement the fix. The three cases should have three different proposed fixes.
3. Create a `lesson8/scenarios/` folder in your repository and commit the three scenario JSONs there
4. Fill in the three descriptions below: what happens in the scenario, how your framework fails, and what change to the framework would fix it. Add screenshots if needed.
5. Commit and push everything, and be ready to demonstrate your failure cases at the practice session

##### Failure case 1

**Scenario.** The ego drives towards a zebra crossing at the speed limit. A pedestrian is triggered to step onto the crossing as the car approaches. The car keeps its speed and hits the pedestrian from the side.

**Why it fails.** The collision checker only sees objects that already overlap the local path. While the pedestrian is still on the kerb they do not exist for the planner, and their velocity is projected onto the path direction, so someone crossing sideways looks like a static object. By the time they are inside the safety corridor there is no distance left to brake in.

**Fix.** Predict where objects are moving and check that against the local path, so a pedestrian heading for the road becomes a collision point before reaching it.

##### Failure case 2

**Scenario.** The ego comes out of a side road onto a main road. A car is approaching along the main road from behind the merge point. The ego pulls out in front of it and gets hit.

**Why it fails.** Collision points are only made for objects on our own path ahead. The approaching car is still upstream of the point where we join, so it never touches our corridor and we treat the road as clear. The map also holds right of way information, but only traffic light regulatory elements are read, so the framework has no idea it should give way here.

**Fix.** Read the right of way elements from the map and add a stop line collision point at the yield line while a car on the priority road is too close.

##### Failure case 3

**Scenario.** Two intersections close to each other. Traffic is queued from a red light at the second one and the queue reaches back across the first. Our light is green, the car drives in and stops inside the intersection, blocking the cross traffic.

**Why it fails.** The planner reacts to the nearest constraint and nothing else. Green means no stop line, and the queue ahead is just an obstacle to stop behind. Both are correct on their own, but nobody checks whether there is space on the other side of the intersection before entering it.

**Fix.** Check the free space after the junction and put a collision point at the junction entry if the car would not fit through.
